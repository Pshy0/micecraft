# micecraft
2D block based module inside Transformice.

For building the Module, do:
1. Clone the repository into your device.
2. Run the `merger.lua` file, found under the `build` directory.
3. A new file called 'micecraft.lua' will appear, which then can be loaded in Transformice.

Stable releases may be found on the `main` branch, while active developing versions may be found on the `development` branch.
